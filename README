Lots of changes from the original code base and a bunch of things I
haven't figured out yet.

Crash probably doesn't work properly.  Need to look into what was
intended here previously and what really should happen.

Interestingly, the design of Qt allows reactor.iterate() to be
re-entrant.  QEventLoops, in general, allow the creation of "local"
event loops which, effectively, hang onto the stack yet re-enter the
event handling mechanism until its time to come back.  Need to loook
at the implementation to see whether this couldn't be more generally
applied to Twisted.

Of course, this might be a very bad idea... Using iterate recursively
is a sure fire way to hang yourself as you block the return of any previous
iterate(). there's only one stack kids...

That being said, there may be times that this is goodness... and, it
would be relatively straightforward to put in a default "no-recursive
iterate" which could be adjusted by the clueful for those cases when
the stack frame is critical....

Finally, if QApplication is not provided, a QCoreApplication is
constructed instead of QApplication (used previously) so its no longer
a GUI...  no X required for buildbot testing etc.
