This seems to be working.

Some core design changes.  There was a bunch of destructing and
constructing of the same timer object.  Now there is one timer
responsible for simulate and everything invokes a call to simulate
through that timer.  A convenience method, pingSimulate, is provided
which sets the timer to timeout immediately.

There appears to be a significant performance advantage which stands
to reason.  Additionally, this method avoids any recursion through the
various methods which require simulate to run immediately.

Note that if a QApplication or QCoreApplication instance isn't
provided at reactor installation, a default QCoreApplication is
constructed.

Included in this directory is a diff of trial's stdout between the
default reactor and the Qt4 reactor.  The large time differences are
due to hangage in some of the I/O tests unrelated to the performance
of the reactor itself which is very good (to be quantified... I think
its very good :-)

# trial twisted $> /tmp/select.trial
# trial --unclean-warnings --reactor=qt4 twisted &> /tmp/qt4.trial
# diff /tmp/select.trial /tmp/qt4.trial > trial.diff
