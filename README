This seems to be working.  I suspect a memory leak and am
investigating.  It passes trial tests with a few errors.

Note that if a QApplication or QCoreApplication instance isn't
provided at reactor install, a QCoreApplication is constructed instead
of QApplication (used previously) so its no longer a GUI...  no X
required for buildbot testing etc.
