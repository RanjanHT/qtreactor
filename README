This seems to be working.

Some core design changes.  There was a bunch of destructing and
constructing of the same timer object.  Now there is one timer
responsible for simulate and everything invokes a call to simulate
through that timer.  A convenience method, pingSimulate, is provided
which sets the timer to timeout immediately.

There appears to be a significant performance advantage which stands
to reason.  Additionally, this method avoids any recursion through the
various methods which require simulate to run immediately.

Note that if a QApplication or QCoreApplication instance isn't
provided at reactor installation, a default QCoreApplication is
constructed.
